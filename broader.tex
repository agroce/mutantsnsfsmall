\section{Broader Impacts}

\paragraph{Improving Software System Reliability:} 

\paragraph{Education and Outreach:}
The proposed research yields several opportunities for enhancing CS
education, recruiting new CS majors, and retaining CS students,
particularly members of underrepresented groups.  
PI Groce will work with the NAU Student ACM Chapter to present a
series of ``excursions in testing'' that introduce automated testing
to students, using feedback-driven mutation testing on real code, including code from
media player libraries.  The work of Guzdial
\cite{Guzdial} has shown that media computation is a
potentially effective way to both recruit and retain female and
under-represented minority students in computer science.
