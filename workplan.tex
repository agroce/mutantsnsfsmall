\subsubsection{Work Plan}

For this project, a simple plan should suffice, defined by components
of Figure \ref{fig:flow}.  In Year One, PI Groce and the graduate
student will both focus on the FPF-Based Novelty Ranking and
representation of mutants and test results.  In Year
Two, both will focus on the Mutant Utility Predictor and Feedback
Analysis, and how to integrate those with the FPF-Based Novelty
Ranking.  In Year Three, the focus will shift to the Mutant Generator
itself, and the problem of any-language mutant generation.  The third
year will also emphasize integrating the entire system and performing
more thorough evaluations.
