Figure \ref{fig:flow} shows the basic outline of a proposed workflow
and components needed to support feedback-driven mutation testing.
These components serve to organize the research plan.


\subsubsection{FPF-Based Novelty Ranking}
\label{sec:fpfplan}

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{Which mutants are most similar?  If the user marked the
  mutant in the upper left corner as uninteresting and added a test
  to kill the
  mutant in the upper middle, which mutant
  should she examine next?}
\label{fig:distances}
\end{figure}

Ranking unkilled mutants according to how much ``new'' information they might
provide to users requires more than simply using the FPF algorithm.
FPF requires a distance metric, and a distance metric requires a
\emph{representation} of mutants.  Mutants can be similar because they
modify the same line, function, class, or module, but also because,
despite being located in very different parts of a program, they are
very semantically similar.  E.g., a mutant to the parser of a compiler, to
an I/O error-handling routine in the code generator, and to a complex
optimization pass may all be very ``similar'' in the only meaningful
sense if all three mutants modify logging statements that don't have
any actual effect on the state of the compiler.  Figure
\ref{fig:distances} shows the fundamental problem.  Elements of the
distance metric must include mutant location, mutation operator, and
some representation of the code element modified --- language
construct, functions called, variables modified, and so forth.  This
is a complex problem in representation and weighting of elements of a
representation, especially for a language- and
project- agnostic metric, perhaps one open to tuning via feedback
analysis.  We plan to exploit metric learning
methods~\cite{kulis2012metric}, but are aware that to avoid over-fitting
to even a set of good examples, the final metric may have to be
hand-tuned.  In part this is due to the difficulty of establishing
large amounts of ground truth data; although there are unsupervised
approaches to metric learning~\cite{scholkopf1998nonlinear,tipping1999probabilistic}, the most popular approaches require supervision.

\subsubsection{Mutant Utility Predictor}

Novelty with respect to previously analyzed mutants is not the only
important characteristic of a mutant.

\subsection{Core Research Questions}

\subsubsection{Research Questions for Feedback-Driven Mutation Testing
in General}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is a good generalized, language-agnostic representation
  of and distance metric for program mutants for use in FPF?
\item How can FPF-based selection of mutants for novelty best incorprorate
  predictions of mutant equivalence, outcome, dominance, and
  productivity?  Is novelty or expected utility more important?
\item How should feedback-driven mutation testing actually incorporate feedback from users into the 
  ranking of mutants? 
\item Is it possible to identify outliers in otherwise similar groups of
  mutants, and is such identification useful?
\item How should budgets for automated test generation and
  timeouts for verification efforts be chosen so as to quickly estimate whether a
  mutant is killable?
\item Is it possible to predict whether a mutant's unkillability is due to poor test 
  generation  or due to oracle weakness? 
\item How can feedback-driven mutation testing most effectively use already generated killing tests
  and counterexamples to prune mutants?
\item Is distance-based clustering plus timing information useful for quickly
  eliminating killable mutants similar to already-killed mutants?  How
  does this relate to Predictive Mutation Testing (PMT)?

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Research Questions Specific to Any-Language Mutation}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What advances are required in order to maximize the efficiency and usability of a
  fundamentally language-agnostic regular-expression-based approach to
  mutant generation?
\item How should the language of regular expressions be extended to allow
  for language-agnostic definition of mutation operators that require
  more parser-like analysis of code structure, without compromising
  the usability and simplicity of the approach?
\item Is it possible to perform on-the-fly mutant generation for very
  large projects, and reconcile this approach with FPF (e.g., generate
  new mutants with, possibly approximate, desired distances from
  already evaluated mutants)?
\end{enumerate}
