\section{A Day in the Life of a Systems Programmer}

Laura is developing a data-management system for a NASA rover's software to be used during operation on another planet.  She is responsible both for a catalog process that handles data products, including critical configuration files, for other modules and the implementation of the low-level interface to custom, radiation-hardened, flash software.  Hardware changes have made certain design alterations to existing NASA-developed file systems essential, and Laura's expertise in the file system's performance has resulted in her also being assigned the task of constructing the higher-level module that gives access to the low-level persistent storage interface.

Laura has, in the process of developing the code, also developed a set of manually constructed unit tests and harnesses supporting automated test generation for the system.  She employs static analysis tools, with additional custom rules developed by the rover software team and the NASA facility's software tooling experts.  Laura has also added a few custom rules of her own that capture patterns she wants to enforce on herself with respect to the use of the low-level file system API.

Today, Laura is continuing an ongoing effort at changing functionality to the catalog and the file system, rewriting the ``rename'' call to provide a more restrictive set of allowed renames than the POSIX standard.  After reviewing the risks of arbitrary rename, the software team has agreed this is a restriction that protects the integrity of data better, while retaining all functionality ground operators might need to fix problems in the file system structure.  As part of this revision, Laura realized that without certain renames being allowed, a simpler scheme for enforcing atomicity of renames would work that could make mounting and checking the file system much easier.

Laura reaches a point where she believes her change is fully implemented and the tests have been revised to check the changed behavior.  She looks at a panel in her IDE showing Test Effectiveness, and notices that there are four Missed Bugs for her to examine.  She clicks on the top one, and the IDE focuses on a line of code in the rename function.  The display shows a change to that line, and says that altering the line in the way shown changes the file system binary but is not detected by any existing manual test or static analysis rule, and has not been detected in two minutes of fuzzing, across multiple cores, or by any stored fuzzing-generated test.

Laura thinks for a while about the change made, which involves passing a flag to the call that disables an expensive ``sanity check'' on header values for a file, to be used in contexts where the header has just been written and checked.  She thinks the current context is unsafe, and the check is required.
